    "description": "# Introduction\n\nThe Nine Self Service API allows you to provision various services using a\nHTTP REST API. The API is based on Kubernetes, meaning existing tooling can be\nused to interact with it.\n\n## Authentication\n\nThe API uses Bearer Tokens for authentication. You can get a token by creating\nan [API Service Account in Cockpit](https://cockpit.nine.ch/en/api) and\ncopying the associated token. The token has to be sent with each request using\nthe `Authorization: Bearer \u003ctoken\u003e` HTTP header.\n\n## Namespace\n\nAll the resources you can create reside in a namespace allocated for your\nCockpit account. This means with all requests you will have to specify the\nnamespace of the resource you are interacting with. The namespace equals to\nthe account name that is displayed under *Recently Used* in Cockpit. The\nservice account you previously created just has access to resources in the\nsame namespace it resides in.\n\n## Making a first request\n\nTo verify that the token works as expected, you can try to issue the following\nrequest using `curl`. If you get the following reply, the authentication\nworks:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://nineapis.ch/api/ -H \"Authorization: Bearer \u003ctoken\u003e\"\n{\n  \"kind\": \"APIVersions\",\n  \"versions\": [\n    \"v1\"\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Creating a resource with curl\n\nNow that we are authenticated with the API, let's create a first resource with\nit. Note that a lot of resources that can be created on the API incur costs,\nso be careful when testing your integration. Here we create an object storage\nbucket, which by itself is free as long as no data is uploaded to it.\n\n```bash\n$ curl -X POST https://staging.nineapis.ch/apis/storage.nine.ch/v1alpha1/namespaces/\u003cyour namespace\u003e/buckets \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer \u003ctoken\u003e\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  --request POST \\\n  --data '{\n    \"kind\": \"Bucket\",\n    \"apiVersion\": \"storage.nine.ch/v1alpha1\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n        \"name\": \"hello-api\"\n    },\n    \"spec\": {\n        \"forProvider\": {\n            \"encryption\": true,\n            \"location\": \"nine-es34\"\n        }\n    }\n}'\n```\n\n## Resource Status\n\nAfter you create a resource using the API, how do you know it is ready? This\nis where the `status.conditions` field comes in. It represents the current\nstate of that resource. For example, when getting the status of a `Bucket` it\nmight look something like this:\n\n```json\n\"status\": {\n    \"conditions\": [\n        {\n            \"lastTransitionTime\": \"2023-03-05T08:25:41Z\",\n            \"reason\": \"ReconcileSuccess\",\n            \"status\": \"True\",\n            \"type\": \"Synced\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"lastTransitionTime\": \"2023-03-05T08:25:41Z\",\n            \"reason\": \"Available\",\n            \"status\": \"True\",\n            \"type\": \"Ready\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nFor knowing whether a resource is ready to use, the relevant condition is the\none with `type: Ready`. This one indicates whether the backend resource is\nready. The other important field within the condition is the `reason`. The\nfollowing\n[reasons](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/crossplane/crossplane-runtime@v0.12.0/apis/common/v1#ConditionReason)\nexist:\n\n* Available: The resource is available for use.\n* Unavailable: The resource is currently unhealthy, making it temporarily\n  unavailable.\n* Creating: The resource is currently being created.\n* Deleting The resource is currently being deleted.\n\nFor catching errors during the creation process, one should look for the `type: Synced`.\nThere is a `reason` field, same as with the ready status. Here we simply have\nthese reasons:\n\n* ReconcileSuccess: The resource has at successfully reconciled at least once.\n  Note that this does not mean it is ready to use.\n* ReconcileError: The resource experienced an error during reconciliation. In\n  this case, have a look at the `message` field to tell you more about why it\n  errored.\n\n## Connection Secret\n\nFor resources which need credentials to access them after creation, there is a\nsystem in place to automatically write those credentials to a normal Kubernetes\nsecret. For example, when creating a `BucketUser` it generates an S3 access key\nand secret which can then be used to authenticate against the object storage. As\na user you can simply tell the `BucketUser` where to write those credentials by\nusing the `spec.writeConnectionSecretToRef` field.\n\n```json\n\"spec\": {\n  \"writeConnectionSecretToRef\": {\n      \"name\": \"some-secret\",\n      \"namespace\": \"\u003cyour namespace\u003e\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the credentials would end up in the secret `a-secret` within your\norganizations namespace.\n",

Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.\n\nWhen a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.\n\nBefore serializing, Quantity will be put in \"canonical form\". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:\n  a. No precision is lost\n  b. No fractional digits will be emitted\n  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.\nThe sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.\n\nExamples:\n  1.5 will be serialized as \"1500m\"\n  1.5Gi will be serialized as \"1536Mi\"\n\nNote that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.\n\nNon-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)\n\nThis format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.",

This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.\n\nPopulated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only.

Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock.

Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object.
