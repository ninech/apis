              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

              CreationTimestampNano is the unix nano timestamp of the release when
              it was created. It can be used to order releases and find the most
              current one. It provides a higher accuracy than the normal
              kubernetes resource CreationTimestamp which only has a resolution
              down to a second.
