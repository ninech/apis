              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.

              CreationTimestampNano is the unix nano timestamp of the release when
              it was created. It can be used to order releases and find the most
              current one. It provides a higher accuracy than the normal
              kubernetes resource CreationTimestamp which only has a resolution
              down to a second.

                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
