# Nine APIs

This repository contains the API definitions of all the public APIs available
on [nineapis.ch](https://nineapis.ch) in several forms:

* Go type definitions in the module `github.com/ninech/apis`
* Kubernetes CRDs in `config/crds`
* API docs and OpenAPI spec in `docs/`

Note that everything related to the API definitions is generated and synced
over from an internal Nine repo and should not be modified here.

The docs are available in a rendered form at
[docs.nineapis.ch](https://docs.nineapis.ch).
